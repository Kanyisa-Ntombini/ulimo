## Background

Max is a retiree from a village outside Queenstown in the Eastern Cape Province. He worked in cooperate in Johannesburg his whole life. He retired two years ago and decided to go back to his village and give back. In rural areas in the Eastern Cape, there are fields outside each village allocated to community members. In Maxâ€™s village, these fields were unused and had been invaded by alien plants. He approached the owners of the land with an idea. They would clear the land off the alien plants and then he would combine the land into one big piece of land. He would then plant the land with his own money, harvest it and then sell the crops. He would then split the money with the landowners.

## Max's Challenges

### Lack of Information on Farming Management
1. There is no clear policy about farming from the National level that extends to the provincial level
2. There is no information from the government on how to insure crops and livestock and the value of that insurance
3. There is no information on where to buy or rent machinery within the Eastern Cape province
